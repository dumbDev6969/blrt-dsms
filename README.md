# Web-based Intelligent Driving School Management and Enrollment System (BLRT-DSMS)

BLRT-DSMS is a role-based operations platform for managing the full lifecycle of a driving school — from student and instructor onboarding, through document verification and enrollment approval, to scheduled driving sessions, formal skills assessment, and grading. The system's "intelligence" comes from two places: an automated instructor-matching engine that assigns the best-fit instructor to an approved enrollment based on skill set, vehicle/transmission compatibility, weekly availability, and current workload, and a Google Dialogflow-powered chatbot that gives prospective and enrolled users conversational access to information about the school. The application is built entirely on the TALL stack, using Livewire 4's single-file component syntax for every interactive page — there is no separate REST/JSON API layer; all client-server interaction happens over Livewire's wire protocol.

## Core System Features

Every feature below was verified directly against the routes, Livewire components, and service classes in this repository — nothing here is generic boilerplate.

- **Role-Based Multi-Portal Access** — Four distinct roles (`Admin`, `Instructor`, `Student`, `Staff`) are seeded via Spatie Permission, each gated to its own set of routes through `can:` middleware (e.g. `can:user.view`, `can:enrollment.view_any`, `can:student.view_any`, `can:instructor.view_own`).
- **Guided Profile Onboarding** — New Students and Instructors are redirected to a mandatory profile-completion wizard (`student/onboard`, `instructor/onboard`) by the custom `EnsureProfileIsComplete` middleware before they can reach any other authenticated page.
- **Multi-Step Enrollment Form Pipeline** — Students submit an `EnrollmentForm` (draft → submitted → approved/rejected) capturing package type (TDC/PDC/Refresher), vehicle category, transmission preference, and JSON-stored personal info and schedule preferences. Staff review and approve/reject forms with a recorded rejection reason and reviewer audit trail.
- **Automated Instructor Matching Engine** (`EnrollmentService::findBestInstructor`) — On enrollment approval, the system filters active/verified instructors by required skill (theoretical vs. practical), transmission type, vehicle category, and weekly schedule overlap with the student's preferred days, then ranks remaining candidates by current active-enrollment workload to balance instructor load automatically. Students with no available match are placed on a `waiting_list`.
- **Document Upload & Verification Pipeline** — Students upload required documents (birth certificate, medical certificate, ADL form, valid ID, TDC certificate, TIN ID, passport, etc.) which enter a `pending → verified/rejected` review queue for Admin/staff, with private file storage served through an authorized streaming route (`document/serve/{document}`).
- **Instructor Availability Engine** (`InstructroAvailabilityService`) — Computes a rolling 30-day availability calendar per instructor by cross-referencing their stored weekly schedule against existing booking sessions.
- **Booking Session & Assessment Tracking** — Tracks individual lecture/driving/assessment sessions, including score, pass/fail outcome, student ratings, per-skill JSON progress tracking, and a full change-log audit trail.
- **Formal Driving Assessment Forms** — A structured, section-by-section practical assessment (pre-drive checklist, immediate-fail criteria, driving skills rating, traffic rule observance, learner-type classification) modeled directly on the physical LTO assessment form, complete with instructor and admin sign-off fields.
- **Instructor Grading & Metrics** (`InstructorGradingService`, `InstructorMetricService`) — Finalizes course grades transactionally, auto-creates the corresponding theoretical assessment record, closes out related booking sessions, and rolls results into monthly per-instructor performance metrics (pass rate, average rating, sessions completed).
- **Live Analytics** (`SystemMetric::syncToday`) — Daily aggregate snapshot of revenue, new student signups, active enrollments, completed courses, and total bookings.
- **AI Chatbot Assistant** — A Livewire-powered chat widget backed by Google Dialogflow's `SessionsClient`, with per-session conversation history stored server-side and graceful fallback messaging if the Dialogflow API call fails.
- **Vehicle Fleet Management** — Tracks vehicle type, transmission, maintenance history (JSON), and next scheduled maintenance date, with live status (`available`, `maintenance`, `in-use`).
- **LTO-Accredited Clinic Directory** — Maintains accredited third-party clinic records (for medical certificates, etc.) with accreditation expiry tracking.
- **Two-Factor Authentication & Email Verification** — Full Fortify-driven 2FA (with recovery codes) and mandatory email verification gating access to the dashboard.
- **PWA Support** — Includes a service worker, web manifest, and a dedicated offline fallback route (`/offline`) that is intentionally excluded from all auth middleware to avoid redirect loops when the user is offline.

## System Requirements & Initialization

The application enforces several runtime safeguards in `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php` that any developer or deployer must be aware of:

- **Immutable Dates by Default** — `Date::use(CarbonImmutable::class)` is set globally, meaning every date/time helper (`now()`, Eloquent date casts, etc.) throughout the app returns a `CarbonImmutable` instance rather than mutable `Carbon`. Code that expects to mutate a date object in place (`$date->addDay()`) will not work as it might in a default Laravel app — always reassign the returned value.
- **Destructive Command Protection in Production** — `DB::prohibitDestructiveCommands(app()->isProduction())` blocks destructive Artisan commands (e.g. `migrate:fresh`, `db:wipe`) whenever `APP_ENV=production`. This is a hard safety rail, not a suggestion — it cannot be bypassed with `--force`.
- **Stepped-Up Password Policy in Production** — `Password::defaults()` enforces a minimum 12-character password with mixed case, letters, numbers, symbols, and a "not previously compromised" check (via the Have I Been Pwned API) automatically once the app runs in production. In non-production environments, no default policy is enforced.
- **Mandatory Dialogflow Credential Validation on Boot** — `configureDialogflow()` runs on every non-console boot (console/artisan commands and unit tests are exempted) and throws a `RuntimeException` immediately if the file at `services.dialogflow.credentials_json` is missing or the config value is blank. **The application will not boot in a browser context without a valid Dialogflow service-account JSON file present at the configured path.** See the setup steps below to avoid this on first run.

## Local Installation & Setup

> Prerequisites: PHP ^8.2, Composer, Node.js, and [Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com) (or any local server capable of serving `.test` domains).

1. **Clone the repository and install dependencies**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dumbDev6969/blrt-dsms.git blrt-dsms
   cd blrt-dsms
   composer install
   npm install
   ```

2. **Create your environment file**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

3. **Configure `APP_URL` and the database connection** in `.env`:
   ```env
   APP_URL=http://blrt-dsms-main.test
   DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
   ```
   (`DB_CONNECTION=sqlite` is already the default in `.env.example` — just confirm it wasn't overridden.)

4. **Configure the Dialogflow credentials — required before the app will boot.** Add the following to `.env` (these keys are not present in `.env.example` by default and must be added manually):
   ```env
   DIALOGFLOW_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   DIALOGFLOW_CREDENTIALS=app/google-auth.json
   ```
   Place your Google Cloud service-account JSON key file at `storage/app/google-auth.json` (the path is resolved relative to `storage_path()`). Without this file present at boot, every non-console request will throw a `RuntimeException` from `AppServiceProvider::configureDialogflow()`.

5. **Create the SQLite database file:**
   ```bash
   # Git Bash / macOS / Linux
   touch database/database.sqlite

   # PowerShell
   New-Item -ItemType File -Path database/database.sqlite -Force
   ```

6. **Run migrations and seeders:**
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate --seed
   ```
   This seeds roles/permissions (`Admin`, `Instructor`, `Student`, `Staff`) along with one demo account per role, all using the password `password`:
   | Role | Email |
   |---|---|
   | Admin | `admin@blrt.com` |
   | Instructor | `instructor@blrt.com` |
   | Student | `student@blrt.com` |
   | Staff | `staff@blrt.com` |

7. **Compile frontend assets and start the dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Or run the server, queue listener, and Vite dev server concurrently with a single command:
   ```bash
   composer run dev
   ```

8. Visit `http://blrt-dsms-main.test` (via Herd) and log in with one of the seeded demo accounts above.

> Note: Files under `resources/views/pages/**` and several components use Livewire 4's single-file component convention, prefixed with a `⚡` symbol in the filename (e.g. `⚡onboard.blade.php`) to denote a class-and-markup-combined component.
